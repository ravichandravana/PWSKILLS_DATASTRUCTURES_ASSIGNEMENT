This means the time it takes to access a value does not depend on the size of the dictionary\n","        \n","        Worst Case: O(n):=In rare cases, when there are many collisions (two or more keys having the same hash), the dictionary may fall back to linear search to resolve these collisions, resulting in O(n) time complexity.\n","        \n","  18.In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n","     ->Lists are preferred over dictionaries when you need an ordered collection, indexed access, duplicates, or need to perform sorting and slicing.\n","\n","  19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n","     ->Dictionaries are considered unordered because they store data in a hash table, and this affects data retrieval by allowing fast access via keys but not by order.\n","\n","  20.Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n","     ->List: Data is retrieved by index (position), meaning you access elements in a specific order.\n","\n","      Dictionary: Data is retrieved by key, allowing fast lookups but with no inherent order.\n","\n","      Performance: Lists require sequential searching (O(n)) for non-indexed access, while dictionaries offer constant time lookup (O(1)) for key-based access.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","     \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","     \n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"YUQjpQmhRDG2"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["PRACTICAL QUESTIONS\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"cZiA8x65dr5o"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["1.Write a code to create a string with your name and print it?\n"],"metadata":{"id":"p5yJ3fHodpUw"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["name=\"Ravi Chandra\"\n","print(name)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"f80Ej-RTd4Gi","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1745208405668,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":16,"user":{"displayName":"Ravi Vana","userId":"12843693042917623631"}},"outputId":"88d3a3c9-e6bd-4bcc-c451-09deac586435"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Ravi Chandra\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["2 Write a code to find the length of the string \"Hello World\"?\n"],"metadata":{"id":"IJGN0TQbeIF9"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["string= \"Hello World\"\n","print(len(string))"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"rlo-LjuNeMwq","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1745208417660,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":28,"user":{"displayName":"Ravi Vana","userId":"12843693042917623631"}},"outputId":"bfe7ad89-edf8-442e-e589-cd284998ab4a"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["11\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["3.Write a code to slice the first 3 characters from the string \"Python Programming\"?\n"],"metadata":{"id":"oNl5cr-eeU6g"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["string=\"Python Programming\"\n","print(string[0:3])"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"V2bUY0WphT0L","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1745208427289,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"Ravi Vana","userId":"12843693042917623631"}},"outputId":"cc624926-5fa3-44da-9a4a-b918049d4a01"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Pyt\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["4.Write a code to convert the string \"hello\" to uppercase?\n"],"metadata":{"id":"w5Q2WdBZh4-U"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["string=\"hello\"\n","print(string.upper())"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"PcDVrx0Bh9QS","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1745208594240,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":45,"user":{"displayName":"Ravi Vana","userId":"12843693042917623631"}},"outputId":"bb3df2ef-ae65-4d6e-92a1-5f7de77f545e"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["HELLO\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["5.Write a code to replace the word \"apple\" with \"orange\" in the string \"I like apple\"?\n"],"metadata":{"id":"ydEv-Iayif9A"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["string=\"I like apple\"\n","new_string=string.replace(\"apple\",\"orange\")\n","print(new_string)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"iPlX2HzQitgp","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1745208868989,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":26,"user":{"displayName":"Ravi Vana","userId":"12843693042917623631"}},"outputId":"f4cd3706-f517-48cd-de86-23dba04779f0"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["I like orange\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["6.
